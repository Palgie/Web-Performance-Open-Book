CSS
=========================

## Architecture Matters

One of the biggest considerations for building an quick and light application is how you and the development team manage and update the CSS. Not only for the first phases of your development project but a continued maintenence. This is a very common thing to overlook that too often results in an uncomprensible monster of a CSS file after only a few months of continued development.

The file size of your CSS file is of higher priority to other files due to the priority the browser gives to this file during the render process. A CSS file typically falls into the critical render path as the page will not download until all blocking `.css` files are downloaded. Because of this there are many considerations for every aspect of the CSS.
