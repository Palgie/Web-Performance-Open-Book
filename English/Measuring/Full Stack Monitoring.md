Full Stack Monitoring
=====================

Real user monitoring will help you understand how performance really effects your users and synthetic tests will allow you to understand the impact of your changes, but when it comes to hosting websites or applications online there is a lot of variables that can effect performance and just knowing how slow or fast your website is going doesn't help you understand the source of the problem.

Anything from overloaded servers, slow AJAX calls, unoptimised DB queries or just a loop in the logic causing a bottleneck can effect your end user response time.

Several options exist to make your approach to resolving problems easier and if you're working on a large codebase it's sensible to consider them.
