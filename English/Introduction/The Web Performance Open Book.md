What is the Web Performance Open Book
=====================================

This book is aimed at gathering the knowledge of web performance pioneers, alongside the experience of fellow Front-End Engineers, Network Engineers, System Administrators and other specialists to act as an ever-evolving source of information for you to help influence your own projects or your place of work.

Performance is a fundamental part of your users' experience. In a world where your personal site or your established eCommerce business is accessible from anywhere in the world, and on an ever-growing list of devices and connections, delivering content quickly and effectively should be a big priority for any aspiring website or application.

Keeping this book open source and within the community will help other performance enthusiasts keep tabs on the best techniques. Rather than explaining just best practices, this book will help you understand high-level problems and offer low-level solutions.
