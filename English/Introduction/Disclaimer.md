=====================================

The contents of this book are considered best practice and in most cases these are widely adopted and proven techniques. As every use case will differ it's important that before and after you apply these techniques you perform your own performance analysis in order to understand the impact it has on your users.

Heavy suggestions may also be made about how to promote good performance or how to enable your team(s) to control aspects of performance. These don't apply to everyone and you should use your own judgement as how to best apply any techniques or suggestions.
